# Project Briefcase

This directory serves as a "briefcase" to maintain persistent context, track progress, and outline the core concept and features for the Co-Creation Canvas application. It's designed to aid continuity in development, especially across sessions or if conversational context is limited.

## Understanding and Using This Briefcase

For detailed information on the contents of this briefcase, how to use them, and the protocol for maintaining context (especially with an AI assistant), please refer to:

**[./briefcase_protocol.md](./briefcase_protocol.md)**

This protocol document is the primary guide for managing and utilizing the project briefcase effectively.

## Core Context Documents

While `briefcase_protocol.md` provides the full details, the key documents you'll typically interact with for project context are:

*   **`CONCEPT_PLAN.md`**: Outlines the application's long-term strategic vision and current feature set.
*   **`PROGRESS_LOG.md`**: A dynamic journal of development progress, current focus, and next steps.
*   **`AI_COLLABORATION_MODEL.md`**: Defines the interaction model with the AI.
*   **`BRIEFCASE_DIGEST.json`**: An aggregated JSON of all key briefcase documents for AI ingestion.

These documents are intended to be updated as the project evolves.

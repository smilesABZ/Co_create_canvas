# Co-Creation Canvas: Progress Log

## Project Inception Date (Approximate)
Early June 2024

## Last Major Milestone / Current State
*(As of June 04, 2025)*
-   **Briefcase Protocol Standardization & `FILE_CHANGELOG.md` Removal:** `briefcase_protocol.md` is now the authoritative guide. `FILE_CHANGELOG.md` has been removed due to redundancy.
-   **Comprehensive Documentation Update:** All core briefcase documents (`README.md`, `CONCEPT_PLAN.md`, `AI_COLLABORATION_MODEL.md`, `briefcase_protocol.md`) and `BRIEFCASE_DIGEST.json` are up-to-date.
-   **Full Canvas Capture:** AI analysis and image saving features now use the entire logical canvas content.
-   **Sticky Connectors (Move & Resize):** Connectors remain attached to elements when those elements are moved or resized.
-   **Edit Mermaid Diagram Functionality:** Users can now edit existing Mermaid diagrams placed on the canvas.
-   **Save/Load Session Functionality:** Full whiteboard sessions (elements, view, name, AI persona) can be saved to `.ccc` files and loaded.
-   **Per-Element AI Summaries (Concise):** Automatic, concise (1-2 sentences) AI-generated summaries for new elements, with "Regenerate" and "Show/Hide" controls. Multimodal for images.
-   **Google Search Grounding & Prompt Cards:** Gemini can use Google Search, and "Save Model Card" includes a history of Gemini interactions.

## Current Focus
-   **Canvas Zoom Functionality:** Implement zoom in/out for the whiteboard. (Next item from backlog).

## Recent Achievements (Summary of last ~8 major feature sets/updates, most recent first)
1.  **Briefcase Protocol Standardization & `FILE_CHANGELOG.md` Removal:** Streamlined documentation by making `briefcase_protocol.md` the primary guide and removing the redundant `FILE_CHANGELOG.md`. All briefcase documents updated. (June 04, 2025).
2.  **Full Canvas Capture for AI/Saving:** Enhanced `getCanvasContentImageBase64` to capture the entire logical canvas, ensuring AI interactions and image exports are comprehensive. (June 2024 - June 2025).
3.  **Sticky Connectors on Element Resize:** Implemented functionality for connectors to remain correctly attached when elements are resized, complementing existing move stickiness. (June 2024 - June 2025).
4.  **Edit Mermaid Diagram Functionality:** Added the ability to edit existing Mermaid diagrams on the canvas, updating their appearance and stored syntax. (June 2024 - June 2025).
5.  **Save/Load Session Functionality:** Implemented comprehensive session persistence, allowing users to save and load their work, including all elements, view state, session name, and AI persona. (June 2024 - June 2025).
6.  **Per-Element AI Summaries (Concise & Automatic):** Implemented automatic generation of concise (1-2 sentences) AI summaries for new elements, with UI controls for regeneration and visibility. This includes multimodal summaries for images. (June 2024 - June 2025).
7.  **Google Search Grounding & Prompt Cards in Model Card:** Integrated Google Search grounding for Gemini and enhanced "Save Model Card" to include a history of Gemini interactions. (June 2024 - June 2025).
8.  **Core Drawing, Element, and AI Features:** Initial implementation of drawing tools, element management, AI interaction, Mermaid integration, connector logic (including initial stickiness on move), and export functionalities. (June 2024).


## Identified Bugs/Issues (High-Level)
-   **Undo/Redo:** Full undo/redo stack for all actions is a major missing feature.
-   **Manual Re-attachment of Free-Floating Connectors:** Re-attaching detached connector endpoints by dragging them to snap targets is not fully implemented.
-   **Increased API Calls:** Automatic summary generation for each new element will increase API usage.
-   **Gemini Drawing Precision:** Ongoing refinement may be needed for complex drawing requests.
-   **Performance with Very Large Canvases:** Optimizations might be needed.
-   **Mermaid Rendering Timeouts:** More dynamic handling for complex diagrams.
-   **Text Editing UX:** `ContentBoxEditorModal` is functional; `TextInputOverlay` for shapes is basic.

## Potential Next Steps / Backlog (High-Level - Refer to `CONCEPT_PLAN.md` for a more exhaustive list)
1.  **Canvas Zoom Functionality:** Implement zoom in/out. (Current Focus).
2.  **Undo/Redo System:** Implement a robust undo/redo mechanism.
3.  **Richer Text Editing for `ContentBoxElement`s.**
4.  **Manual Re-attachment of Connector Endpoints.**
5.  **Per-Element AI Summaries (UI/UX Refinements).**

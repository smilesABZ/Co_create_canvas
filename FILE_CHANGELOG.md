# Application File Change Log

## Version Control Details

- **File Versioning:** The "Version" information noted for each file (e.g., `v1`, `v5 (Path Fixes)`) is derived directly from comments embedded within the respective source code files (e.g., `// FILENAME: index.tsx - VERSION: v1`). These versions are typically updated by the AI when significant changes are made to a file as per user requests.

- **Changelog Purpose:** This `FILE_CHANGELOG.md` serves as a high-level, human-readable summary of major changes, refactoring efforts, and bug fixes applied to the application, primarily those orchestrated or implemented by the AI assistant during development sessions. It helps track the evolution of the application's modules and features from the AI's perspective.

- **Not a Git Replacement:** This changelog **does not replace a formal version control system (VCS) like Git**. For detailed commit history, precise diffs between changes, branching, merging, and collaborative development, a dedicated VCS such as Git should be used. This document is supplementary and provides a narrative of AI-assisted development.

## File Updates Log

### Briefcase Protocol Standardization
- **Date:** June 04, 2025
- **Description:**
    - Added `briefcase/briefcase_protocol.md` as the new authoritative document for managing the project briefcase.
    - Simplified `briefcase/README.md` to be a concise entry point, directing users to `briefcase_protocol.md` for detailed information. Redundant "Contents" and "Usage Protocol" sections were removed from the README.
    - Updated `briefcase/BRIEFCASE_DIGEST.json` to include the content of the new `briefcase_protocol.md`.
- **Files Affected:**
    - `briefcase/briefcase_protocol.md` (New file, content provided by user)
    - `briefcase/README.md`
    - `briefcase/BRIEFCASE_DIGEST.json`
    - `FILE_CHANGELOG.md`
    - `briefcase/PROGRESS_LOG.md`

### Comprehensive Documentation and Briefcase Update
- **Date:** June 03, 2025
- **Description:** Updated all primary documentation and briefcase files to ensure consistency and reflect the latest state. This includes `FILE_CHANGELOG.md`, `briefcase/README.md`, `briefcase/CONCEPT_PLAN.md`, `briefcase/PROGRESS_LOG.md`, `briefcase/AI_COLLABORATION_MODEL.md`, and regenerated `briefcase/BRIEFCASE_DIGEST.json`.
- **Files Affected:**
    - `FILE_CHANGELOG.md`
    - `briefcase/README.md`
    - `briefcase/CONCEPT_PLAN.md`
    - `briefcase/PROGRESS_LOG.md`
    - `briefcase/AI_COLLABORATION_MODEL.md`
    - `briefcase/BRIEFCASE_DIGEST.json`

### Feature: Full Canvas Capture for AI and Image Saving
- **Conceptual Date of Implementation:** June 01, 2025
- **Description:** Modified `App.tsx`'s `getCanvasContentImageBase64` function to consistently capture the entire logical canvas. This involves calculating a bounding box encompassing all elements, rendering them to a temporary canvas, and then using this complete image for AI analysis, "Save Image", and "Save Model Card" features. This ensures comprehensiveness regardless of the current viewport.
- **Files Affected:**
    - `App.tsx` (v29): Updated `getCanvasContentImageBase64` implementation.

### Feature: Sticky Connectors on Element Resize
- **Conceptual Date of Implementation:** June 01, 2025
- **Description:** Implemented functionality to ensure that when an element (shape, image, content box) is resized, any connectors attached to it automatically update their start/end points to maintain their connection to the correct attachment handle on the resized element.
- **Files Affected:**
    - `src/features/interactions/useInteractionManager.ts` (v16): Updated `handleMouseMove` to adjust attached connectors during resize operations.

### Feature: Edit Mermaid Diagram Functionality
- **Conceptual Date of Implementation:** June 01, 2025
- **Description:** Added the ability for users to edit existing Mermaid diagrams that have been placed on the canvas. This includes storing the original Mermaid syntax with the image element, providing an "Edit Diagram" button, and updating the image on the canvas after edits.
- **Files Affected:**
    - `types.ts` (v13): Added `mermaidSyntax?: string` to `ImageElement` and `editMermaid` to `ElementSummaryActionButton`.
    - `src/features/mermaid/useMermaid.ts` (v2): Modified to store syntax, accept initial syntax and ID for editing, and update existing elements.
    - `src/features/canvas/canvasUtils.ts` (v11): Added "Edit Diagram" button and icon for relevant image elements.
    - `src/features/interactions/useInteractionManager.ts` (v15): Handled "Edit Diagram" button clicks to open the Mermaid modal with existing context.
    - `App.tsx` (v28): Passed `mermaidHook` to `useInteractionManager`.

### Feature: Save/Load Session Functionality
- **Conceptual Date of Implementation:** June 01, 2025
- **Description:** Implemented the ability to save the entire whiteboard session to a `.ccc` file and load it back. This includes all elements, the current view position, the session name, and the selected AI persona.
- **Files Affected:**
    - `constants.ts`: Added `SESSION_FILE_EXTENSION` and updated `ALL_SUPPORTED_IMPORT_EXTENSIONS`.
    - `components/Toolbar.tsx`: Added dedicated "Save Session" and "Load Session" buttons and associated props.
    - `src/features/fileOperations/useFileOperations.ts`:
        - Implemented `saveSession` function to serialize session data (including AI persona) to JSON and trigger download.
        - Updated `handleFileSelected` to parse `.ccc` files and restore the application state (including AI persona).
        - Added `isSessionSaving` state.
    - `App.tsx`: Wired up the new toolbar buttons and props from `useFileOperations`.
    - `briefcase/PROGRESS_LOG.md` and `briefcase/CONCEPT_PLAN.md`: Updated to reflect this new feature.
